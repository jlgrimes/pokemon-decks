3-3 Bibarel: Getting 2 out is insane, could probably drop to 2-2 but if someone targets bibarel that's sad
3 Burmy because you're most definitely going to accidentally mill 1/2 worm early on
1 Golisopod over 2 because it's not that important
1 Manaphy for Rapid Strike, could definitely be cut if dependent on meta
1 Meowth because meowth is broken with Bibarel
1 Lumineon for guaranteed supporter hit. Need a lot less with the cram build, but a nice guarantee to have

4 Boss because boss is a good card
1 echoing horn because we run 4 boss - easy prize
1 quick ball to search off cram for a basic mon without discarding 2
1 air balloon because 2 is too many. Haven't really used much, but 7 energies kinda runs you low on retreat options so it's insurance
1 belt because numbers are good
4 battle pass because this card is ridiculously broken and it solves every consistency issue the deck has
4 great ball because why not
4 cram because you can cram for battle pass or cram AWAY battle pass for literally anything you need. Even if you flip tails you're fine.

3 Turbo because you don't need the 4th, although if you overextend or have bad prizes, tough

General Notes:
Maybe some more 1 of cards to grab off cram to capitalize on cram being a card
Mightyena + Miltank go in when next set comes out
Haven't tested echoing horn a ton

Matchups:
Dureldeon you lose, idk how to not have that happen
Everything else you beat
Single prize decks are still favorable because your deck is very consistent.

Cuttable cards:
Manaphy if Jolt dies
Echoing horn if something can be dureldeon. Will probably cut this for mighteyena.

Potential put-ins:
2nd air balloon is good for the early game i guess, still need to test consistency waters out
2nd golisopod or yveltal seems good against mew heavy meta. If I was going to SLC i'd probably have this
